# Hey there! 👋 I'm Sacha

**Full Stack Developer** 

+7 years building web applications. I write code that works, write tests because I should, and refactor when things get messy.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Backend:** PHP (Symfony), Node.js  
**Frontend:** TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Vue.js  
**Database:** MySQL, PostgreSQL  
**Tools:** Docker, Git, Linux, CI/CD  
**Testing:** PHPUnit, Behat, Jest (when I remember)

## 💼 What I Do

- Build and maintain web applications (mostly SaaS)
- Work with legacy code (because someone has to)
- Write tests (PHPUnit, Behat) - not because I love it, but because bugs in production suck
- Docker setups for dev environments
- TypeScript migrations when the codebase gets too messy
- Actually read documentation before asking questions

## 🎯 Philosophy

- Tests aren't fun, but they're less painful than debugging production at 3am
- Code quality > shipping fast and breaking everything
- TypeScript types > "any" everywhere (fight me)
- Good documentation saves everyone's time
- Legacy code isn't bad code, it's just old code that needs love

## 🌍 Work Setup

- **Location:** Logroño (CET/CEST)
- **Work style:** Remote, async-friendly
- **Languages:** Spanish (native), English (good enough for tech)
- **Availability:** Flexible, productive late evening/night

## 📚 Random Stuff

- Experimenting with Docker setups
- Learning by breaking things, then fixing them
- Most of my "real" work is in private repos (NDAs and stuff)

🔍 **Looking for:** Remote work where people value doing things right over doing things fast.
